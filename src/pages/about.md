  <h3>About</h3>
</div>

Hello, my name is Ranon, an aspiring developer and current student at [SMU](https://www.smu.edu.sg/).
My current passion is in programming, and am currently in the process of mastering various technologies, such as TypeScript, Vue, Go and MongoDB.

This project uses the [Vitesse](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse) by [Anthony Fu](https://github/antfu), which is *"an opinionated [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) starter template for mocking apps swiftly"*. I have chosen this template to speed up the structuring process as it comes prebuilt with various useful features I belive will be useful for my learning.


Outside of programming, I enjoy playing video games and hanging out with friends.
